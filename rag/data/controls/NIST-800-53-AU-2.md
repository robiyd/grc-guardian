# NIST 800-53 AU-2: Audit Events

## Control ID
AU-2

## Framework
NIST 800-53 Rev 5

## Control Family
Audit and Accountability

## Control Summary
Organizations must:
- Determine which events require auditing on the system
- Coordinate security audit function with other organizational entities
- Provide rationale for why auditable events are deemed adequate
- Review and update audited events periodically
- Audit events related to successful/unsuccessful account access, account management, object access, policy changes, privilege functions, and system-level events

## What GRC Guardian Checks

### AWS Config Rules Mapped
- `cloudtrail-enabled` - CloudTrail logging is active
- `cloud-trail-log-file-validation-enabled` - Log file integrity validation enabled
- `s3-bucket-logging-enabled` - S3 access logging enabled for audit trail buckets
- `cloudwatch-alarm-action-check` - CloudWatch alarms configured for security events

### AWS Resources Evaluated
- CloudTrail trails
- CloudWatch Log Groups
- S3 Bucket logging configuration
- VPC Flow Logs

## Expected Evidence Fields
- `resource_type`: AWS::CloudTrail::Trail
- `compliance_type`: COMPLIANT, NON_COMPLIANT
- `annotation`: Details about logging status, management events, data events
- `timestamp`: When logging configuration was last checked

## Remediation Guidance
For missing audit events:
1. Enable CloudTrail in all regions
2. Configure management events (read and write)
3. Enable log file validation for integrity
4. Store CloudTrail logs in S3 with encryption
5. Set up CloudWatch Logs for real-time monitoring
6. Configure alerts for suspicious activities

## Security Considerations
- **OWASP AAI05 - Insufficient Agent Monitoring**: Without proper audit logs, agent actions can't be traced
- **OWASP LLM09 - Overreliance**: Audit trails help detect when agents make incorrect decisions
- Critical for incident response and forensics
