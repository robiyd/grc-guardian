# NIST 800-53 AC-2: Account Management

## Control ID
AC-2

## Framework
NIST 800-53 Rev 5

## Control Family
Access Control

## Control Summary
Organizations must:
- Establish conditions for group and role membership
- Identify authorized users, group/role membership, and access authorizations
- Require approval from designated personnel for account creation
- Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts in accordance with policy
- Monitor system account use and review accounts periodically
- Notify account managers when accounts are no longer required
- Deactivate temporary/emergency accounts after an organization-defined time period

## What GRC Guardian Checks

### AWS Config Rules Mapped
- `iam-user-mfa-enabled` - Ensures IAM users have MFA enabled
- `iam-password-policy` - Validates password complexity requirements
- `access-keys-rotated` - Checks that access keys are rotated within 90 days
- `iam-user-no-policies-check` - Ensures IAM users don't have inline policies

### AWS Resources Evaluated
- IAM Users
- IAM Groups
- IAM Roles
- IAM Policies

## Expected Evidence Fields
- `resource_type`: AWS::IAM::User, AWS::IAM::Role
- `compliance_type`: COMPLIANT, NON_COMPLIANT
- `annotation`: Details about account status, MFA configuration, policy attachments
- `timestamp`: When the account was last evaluated

## Remediation Guidance
For non-compliant accounts:
1. Enable MFA for all IAM users
2. Rotate access keys older than 90 days
3. Remove unnecessary inline policies
4. Implement account lifecycle management
5. Set up CloudTrail for account activity monitoring
