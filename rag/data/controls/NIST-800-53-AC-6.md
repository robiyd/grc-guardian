# NIST 800-53 AC-6: Least Privilege

## Control ID
AC-6

## Framework
NIST 800-53 Rev 5

## Control Family
Access Control

## Control Summary
Organizations must:
- Employ the principle of least privilege for system access
- Authorize access to security functions and security-relevant information only
- Grant users (or processes acting on behalf of users) only the minimum privileges necessary
- Implement least privilege for specific duties and information systems
- Review user privileges periodically and adjust as needed

## What GRC Guardian Checks

### AWS Config Rules Mapped
- `iam-policy-no-statements-with-admin-access` - No policies grant full admin
- `iam-user-no-policies-check` - Users don't have direct policy attachments
- `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited` - S3 buckets not publicly readable
- `s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited` - S3 buckets not publicly writable

### AWS Resources Evaluated
- IAM Policies (managed and inline)
- IAM Roles
- S3 Bucket Policies
- Resource-based policies

## Expected Evidence Fields
- `resource_type`: AWS::IAM::Policy, AWS::S3::Bucket
- `compliance_type`: COMPLIANT, NON_COMPLIANT
- `annotation`: Details about excessive permissions or public access
- `timestamp`: When the policy was last evaluated

## Remediation Guidance
For over-privileged resources:
1. Review and remove `Action: "*"` or `Resource: "*"` in policies
2. Use AWS managed policies instead of custom admin policies
3. Implement permission boundaries for IAM users
4. Remove public access from S3 buckets unless explicitly required
5. Use AWS Access Analyzer to identify unused permissions

## Security Considerations
- **OWASP LLM08 - Excessive Agency**: Overprivileged service accounts can be exploited by compromised agents
- **OWASP AAI03 - Unbounded Agent Actions**: Agents should have scoped permissions, not full admin access
- Principle of least privilege is critical for AI agent safety
