# ISO 27001 A.5.15: Access Control

## Control ID
A.5.15

## Framework
ISO/IEC 27001:2022

## Control Family
Organizational Controls

## Control Summary
Rules to control physical and logical access to information and other associated assets shall be established and implemented based on business and information security requirements. This includes:
- Access control policy covering all types of access
- Rights of access based on need-to-use principle
- Procedures for granting, reviewing, and revoking access rights
- Documentation of access rights for each user and asset
- Regular review of access rights (at least annually)
- Removal of access rights when employment/contract terminates

## What GRC Guardian Checks

### AWS Config Rules Mapped
- `iam-user-mfa-enabled` - MFA for authentication
- `iam-user-no-policies-check` - Proper permission delegation
- `access-keys-rotated` - Credential lifecycle management
- `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited` - Access restrictions
- `s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled` - Data protection

### AWS Resources Evaluated
- IAM Users, Groups, and Roles
- S3 Bucket policies and ACLs
- KMS key policies
- VPC security groups
- Resource-based policies

## Expected Evidence Fields
- `resource_type`: AWS::IAM::User, AWS::S3::Bucket
- `compliance_type`: COMPLIANT, NON_COMPLIANT
- `annotation`: Access control policy violations
- `timestamp`: Control evaluation timestamp

## Remediation Guidance
To align with ISO 27001 A.5.15:
1. Document access control policy
2. Implement need-to-use access provisioning
3. Enforce MFA for all users
4. Conduct quarterly access rights reviews
5. Automate access revocation for terminated users
6. Maintain access control logs for audit
7. Use IAM roles instead of long-term credentials

## ISO 27001 Annex A Context
This control is part of the Organizational Controls section and must be supported by:
- A.5.1: Policies for information security
- A.5.14: Information transfer
- A.5.16: Identity management
- A.5.18: Access rights

## Certification Requirements
For ISO 27001 certification, you must demonstrate:
- Access control policy exists and is approved
- Access rights are documented
- Regular reviews are conducted
- Technical controls implement the policy

## Security Considerations
- **OWASP AAI03 - Unbounded Agent Actions**: AI agents need scoped access, not broad permissions
- **OWASP LLM08 - Excessive Agency**: Over-privileged agents violate need-to-use principle
- Access control is foundational for AI safety
